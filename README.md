Excessive growth diminishes that mastery. Hence the average incremental growth remains invariant as the system evolves.6) the functional content of an E-type system must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over its lifetime.7) the quality of an E-type system will appear to be declining unless it is rigorously maintained and adapted to operational environment changes8) E-type evolution processes constitute multi-level, multi-loop, multi-agent feedback systems and must be treated as such to achieve significant improvement over any reasonable base. | [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman%27s_laws_of_software_evolution) |
