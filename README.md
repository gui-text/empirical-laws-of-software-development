|   |  | Lehman's laws of software evolution | 1) an E-type system must be continually adapted or it becomes progressively less satisfactory2) as an E-type system evolves, its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it3) E-type system evolution processes are self-regulating with the distribution of product and process measures close to normal4) the average effective global activity rate in an evolving E-type system is invariant over the product's lifetime5) as an E-type system evolves, all associated with it, developers, sales personnel and users, for example, must maintain mastery of its content and behaviour to achieve satisfactory evolution. Excessive growth diminishes that mastery. Hence the average incremental growth remains invariant as the system evolves.6) the functional content of an E-type system must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over its lifetime.7) the quality of an E-type system will appear to be declining unless it is rigorously maintained and adapted to operational environment changes8) E-type evolution processes constitute multi-level, multi-loop, multi-agent feedback systems and must be treated as such to achieve significant improvement over any reasonable base. | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman%27s_laws_of_software_evolution |
